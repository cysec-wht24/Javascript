We should know basics like, Javascript is

    Synchronous: Execute one line of code at a time.
    Single threaded languge: Work on 1 thread, slow language as compared to other
    Execution context: Execute one line of code at a time. Here Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

There are 2 types of code in javascript

    Blocking Code: Block the flow of the program ➜ Read the file
    Non-Blocking Code:Does not block execution ➜ Read file Async

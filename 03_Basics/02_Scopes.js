=> Scopes story starts with var, let and const
=> {} : This is called as scope
=> When {} comes with function or if, then we called its scope
=> When any thing declared inside {} it is called block scope, and outside of {} is called global scope
=> value declare in global scope âžœ it is available in block scope but value declared in block scope is 
    not available in global scope.
=> var is functional scope, where as const, let are block scope.
=> Global scope is different for node environment and browser

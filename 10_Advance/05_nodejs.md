Server
Its a software, not a hardware thats a data center thats different this is software
Server is a software that is ready to serve you at any given time
You can write whole of your server code in js, but js is not that much of a capable language, as this language was designed to run on a browser first, and majority of the module you see like fetch request is coming from the browser itself, the timers that you see is coming from the browser as well and a whole lot of other things, there is no mechanism in js to touch the files, it can't interact with the files which we need as we would be interacting with files as we would be writing in db, interact with network protocol because we would interact with http request as well and other things

Here comes nodejs with makes js a super power helps in network module, file system module, writing file synchronously or asynchronously etc 
Helps you run JavaScript code on the backend (e.g., building APIs, servers, CLI tools).
Nodejs ecosystem consist of javascript, and npm and many other libraries some of which are third party as well
Node js is bundled with many third party libraries as well 
eg - 
1) Libuv which is Asynchronous I/o made simple written in C language (https://libuv.org/)
2) Crypto Library  - for cryptographic stuff (https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)
Another imp thing installed nodejs is 
NPM: A package manager for Node.js which allows you to install, update, and manage third-party libraries (called "packages") used in Node.js projects.
